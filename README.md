In this code, we import the necessary libraries and create a DataFrame with the provided data. Then, we split the data into features (X) and the target (y). 
Next, we split the data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from sklearn.model_selection. We initialize the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier (GaussianNB), train it using the training data, make predictions on the test set, and calculate the accuracy of the classifier using the accuracy_score function from sklearn.metrics. Finally, we print the accuracy score.
